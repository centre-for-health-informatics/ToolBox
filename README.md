# UC CHI toolbox of algorithms and code

We have organized our code as follows:
1. Each folder contains the specific project or manuscript details and codes/algorithms
2. A readme in each folder outlines the files and gives an overview of how to use them
3. A folder entitled "UC_CHI_ArchivedTools" is where we have chosen to store our historical code from manuscripts you may find interesting.  These codes may require updates for new software versions; as they are not being updated, they should be used with caution.


<I>Lastly, this toolbox has resided at many different sites.  This is the official site for our code, and any updates will be added here.  Prior homes have been with the OIPH and MethodsHub sites and are now housed in the <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/centres/centre-health-informatics">Centre for Health Informatics</a> at the University of Calgary.</i>
